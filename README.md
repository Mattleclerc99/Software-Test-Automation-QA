How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? I've prioritized testing with JUnit to verify functionality and reliability. Regular, comprehensive testing, including edge cases, has been crucial for maintaining high code quality and security. I've also stayed updated with best coding practices and security measures from the development phase.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? I've engaged directly with potential users to gather requirements, translating these into detailed specifications. Feedback loops and iterative testing have ensured my software meets user expectations effectively.

How do I approach designing software? Starting with a clear understanding of the problem, I've designed my software with a focus on modularity and scalability. My Contact and ContactService classes reflect a structured approach, allowing for easier future modifications. Integrating JUnit tests early in the design process has ensured each part of the software is tested thoroughly, fostering reliability from the start.
